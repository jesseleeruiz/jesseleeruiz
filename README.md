## A little about me
👋🏽 Hey there! My name is Jesse and I have been building iOS mobile applications since 2019.

My short story: 10+ years in Christian non profit leadership and international outreach coordinator. 5+ years in retail management, sales and customer service. Then decided to career transition into iOS Development.

👨🏽‍🎓I graduated from Lambda School's iOS Development & Computer Science course in Aug 2020 where I boosted my iOS skills and had incredible opportunities to collaborate, lead & mentor other developers. (Now known as Bloom Institute of Technology).

🧑🏽‍💻Received my first offer from Fetch Rewards as an iOS Engineer in Feb 2021. I currently work at Chatbooks.

🦸🏽‍♂️ When I’m not changing the world with coding you can find me spending quality time with my family and friends, crushing an intense CrossFit workout (well, trying at least), watching a show or a movie, or reading a book.

😍 I have a huge passion for TV, movies, streaming, gaming; essentially any forms of entertainment.
📱 I have an enormous interest in application architecture, test-driven development, tvOS, Apple’s AVKit framework & HLS, and delivering top-notch user experiences.

⭐️ Fun Fact: I was an extra for The Office! Yes, the TV show. Can you guess which episode?
