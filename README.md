## A little about me
👋🏽 Hey there! My name is Jesse and I have been building mobile applications in Swift for about 2 years. 
I have 5+ years of background in sales and customer service and then decided to make a career change to iOS development.

👨🏽‍🎓I recently graduated from Lambda School in iOS Development & Computer Science where I boosted my iOS skills and had incredible opportunities to work with & mentor other developers.

✅ Spearhead growth of 100+ Lambda students, representing ~$3 million in student investment, across iOS Development & Computer Science fundamentals.

✅ Directed 12+ team leads performance by setting clear team goals, building morale, providing guidance on weekly study material, listening and answering questions/concerns, and holding daily stand-ups.

✅ Delivered 200+ code reviews to help students learn to write clean, efficient, and reusable code while adhering to styling guidelines.

✅ Coordinated 150+ Zoom office hours to help struggling students by engaging in live debugging and Q&A across iOS Development & Computer Science fundamentals.

✅ Completed 80+ feature-rich iOS app projects during the iOS portion of the curriculum. Apps included the use of asynchronous networking, data persistence with Core Data, unit and UI testing, and integration of Objective-C in a mixed language codebase.

🦸🏽‍♂️ When I’m not changing the world with coding you can find me spending quality time with my family and friends, crushing an intense CrossFit workout (well, trying at least), watching a show or a movie, or reading a book.

😍 I have a huge passion for TV, movies, streaming, gaming; essentially any forms of entertainment.
📱 I have an enormous interest in application architecture, test-driven development, tvOS, Apple’s AVKit framework & HLS, and delivering top-notch user experiences.

📚 Currently reading Testing Swift by Paul Hudson and Working In Public by Nadia Eghbal
⭐️ Fun Fact: I was an extra for The Office! Yes, the TV show. Can you guess which episode?
