## A little about me
I have been in iOS development for about 2 years now; first year learning on my own and second year going through the iOS Development program at Lambda School.
With a background in sales and customer service I bring meaningful and genuine contributions to any project I work on and to any team I work with.  
👨🏽‍🔧 Currently working on updating Vocable, NEWSC, and Journaly projects    
📖 Currently reading [_Testing Swift_ by Paul Hudson](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/testing-swift) and [_Working In Public_ by Nadia Eghbal](https://press.stripe.com/#working-in-public)    
🕵🏽‍♂️Looking for iOS Developer opportunities.   
⚡️Fun Fact: I was an extra for The Office! Yes, the TV show. Can you guess which episode?
